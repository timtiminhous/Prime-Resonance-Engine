    This directory /home/timtim/Development/EinsteinToolkit/Cactus/../CactusSourceJar.git
    is not empty -- it contains a git repository with the Cactus source
    trees of all previous builds, starting on Thu Jan 15 10:50:33 AM CST 2026.

    You can use the command "git branch" to list all configurations that
    are stored in this repository.  The history of each branch is the
    sequence in which the configuration was built.  The most recent
    build is stored in the branch head, as usual.  In order to check out a
    certain branch into a directory <name>, issue the following commands:
            cd <somewhere_else>
            mkdir <name>
            cd <name>
            git init
            git pull /home/timtim/Development/EinsteinToolkit/Cactus/../CactusSourceJar.git <branch>

    You can also use the command "git tag -l" to list all builds that
    are stored in this repository.  This keeps the source tree for each
    build directly accessible.  In order to check out a certain tag into a
    directory <name>, issue the following commands:
            cd <somewhere_else>
            git clone -o <name> /home/timtim/Development/EinsteinToolkit/Cactus/../CactusSourceJar.git
            git checkout <tag>
